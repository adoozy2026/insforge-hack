# Personal Shopper Agent

Multi-agent personal shopper for a 24-hour hackathon. The user describes what
they want; an **Intake** agent gates research behind one clarifying turn; a
**Search Planner** builds a candidate set across retailers; **N Researcher
agents** run in parallel — each one is a visible tile on the dashboard,
surfacing price, condition, seller, shipping, returns, known issues, scam
risk, and alternatives. A **Synthesizer** ranks them; a **Forecaster** writes a
multi-week price-trend narrative.

                                                   | Anthropic SDK + tool-use loops

```

Insforge does **not** expose a direct Postgres connection, so the orchestrator
talks to it via REST. Realtime updates flow the other way: DB triggers call
`realtime.publish()` whenever the pipeline writes a row, and the browser
subscribes to `intent:<id>` to react.

## Layout

```
db/migrations/   SQL — applied via `npx @insforge/cli db migrations up --all`
orchestrator/    FastAPI service — runs on your laptop
web/             Next.js app — deploys to Vercel
```

## One-time setup

### 1. Create the Insforge project

1. Sign in at https://insforge.dev → **Create New Project** (~3 seconds).
2. Grab the **Project ID** from the dashboard URL
   (`https://insforge.dev/dashboard/project/<id>`).
3. From the repo root, link the CLI:
   ```bash
   npx @insforge/cli link --project-id <id>
   ```
4. Apply the schema:
   ```bash
   npx @insforge/cli db migrations up --all
   ```
   This applies `db/migrations/<timestamp>_init.sql`.
5. From the dashboard, copy the **Project URL**, **anon key**, and
   **service role key**.

### 2. Anthropic

API key from https://console.anthropic.com.

### 3. Environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# fill in Insforge + Anthropic values
```

The web app reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_INSFORGE_*` — set the same values in Vercel
project env before deploying.

## Run locally

Two processes — one terminal each.

```bash
# orchestrator (laptop)
cd orchestrator
uv sync
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8787

# web
cd web
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

Orchestrator health: `curl http://localhost:8787/healthz`.

## Deploy the web app to Vercel

```bash
cd web
npx vercel --prod
```

Or connect the repo via the Vercel dashboard. The orchestrator stays on your
laptop — that's the "self-deploy locally via a script" story.

## Fixture mode

Set `FIXTURE_MODE=true` in the orchestrator's env to bypass live web tools
and serve seeded data. Live-demo fallback if any provider rate-limits or
blocks on stage.
