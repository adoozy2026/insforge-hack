"""Tool wiring for the agent pipeline (Gemini stack).

Three tools are exposed:

  * **google_search** — Gemini built-in server tool. Google runs the search and
    returns grounding metadata. No client-side dispatch needed.
  * **url_context** — Gemini built-in server tool. Reads URLs the model sees
    in context. Does not fully render JavaScript pages; for those, fall back
    to ``playwright_fetch``.
  * **playwright_fetch** — local function declaration. Gemini emits a
    ``FunctionCall`` block for it; we run a headless chromium and reply with
    a ``FunctionResponse`` part.

In ``FIXTURE_MODE``, ``playwright_fetch`` short-circuits to canned page
content from ``fixtures.py`` so we never need a browser or network.
